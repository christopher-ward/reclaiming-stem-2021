        <h1>Reclaiming STEM <br> 2020 <br> Workshop</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Reclaiming STEM was founded to address the need for science communication and science policy
        training spaces for people who identify as minoritized groups: BIPOC, first-generation, disabled, LGBTQIA+,
        undocumented, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We organize training for diverse scientists to learn how to communicate their science at the
        intersection of research and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing diversity of scientists requires training that accounts for
        the challenges minoritized groups face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programming seeks and invites only scientists from diverse backgrounds to
        present interactive and innovative workshops centering their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is for attendees to not only gain
        skills but also be able to identify with and envision themselves in science communication and science policy spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are extremely excited about our Virtual Workshop this Fall!
      </p>
