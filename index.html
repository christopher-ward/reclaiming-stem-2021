        <h1>Reclaiming STEM <br> 2021 <br> Workshop</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Reclaiming STEM was founded to address the need for science communication and science policy
        training spaces for people who identify as minoritized groups: BIPOC, first-generation, disabled, LGBTQIA+,
        undocumented, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We organize training for diverse scientists to learn how to communicate their science at the
        intersection of research and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing diversity of scientists requires training that accounts for
        the challenges minoritized groups face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programming seeks and invites only scientists from diverse backgrounds to
        present interactive and innovative workshops centering their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is for attendees to not only gain
        skills but also be able to identify with and envision themselves in science communication and science policy spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are extremely excited about our Virtual Workshop!

        <p>Rob Ulrich (they/he) is a Biogeochemistry Ph.D. student at UCLA who researches how living things make their hard parts.
        More specifically, they are interested in developing and using novel geochemical tracers (e.g., trace elements,
        “clumped” isotopes) to interrogate the strategies used by organisms to make their biominerals. Beyond graduate school,
        Rob is also the Associate Director of the Reclaiming STEM Institute, Co-Founder of Queer & Trans in STEM (fka Queers in
        STEM), a writing consultant, and a writer. Their book (The Hard Parts of Life) about biominerals and their applications
        is currently up for pre-sale and is going to be published in the Spring. In 2019, Rob received the UCLA Curtis Shepard
        LGBT Leadership award for their leadership and outreach to the LGBTQ+ community at UCLA and abroad, and under their
        leadership, Queer & Trans in STEM won the UCLA Organization of the Year award. For their research and advocacy, Rob
        currently holds fellowships with the National Science Foundation and the Center for Diverse Leadership in Science, and
        they have been invited to speak on the popular podcasts, including Ologies, Talk Nerdy, ExoLore, and at meetings for the
        American Geophysical Union, the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, the Geologic Society of America, the
        California Academy of Sciences, and the New York Academy of Sciences. To avoid answering the question “What do you want
        to do after your Ph.D.?”, they hide in their apartment and cook and bake, or outside by hiking and going to the beach.</p>
